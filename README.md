# Chess Web App

## Overview
Welcome to the **Chess Web App**! This project started as a **proof of concept**, aimed at exploring the entire development pipelineâ€”from frontend to backend and DevOps. The goal is to build a fully functional online chess game, combining real-world chess mechanics with modern web technologies.

Users can seamlessly play chess directly in their browser, either against an AI opponent or in real-time with friends.

Feel free to explore the app as it evolves:
