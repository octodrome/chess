# Welcome to Nuxt Chess

This project started as a frontend portfolio app I worked on during my freelance developer days. Over time, it grew into an opportunity to learn and practice every part of the development process‚ÄîUI/UX design, frontend, backend, and DevOps. My goal is to build a fully functional online chess game, combining real-world chess mechanics with modern web technologies, while growing full-stack skills.

## üöÄ Continuous Integration and Deployment

![alt text](./documentation/diagrams/environments.png?raw=true)

The Nuxt Chess app uses an automated pipeline to streamline the process from code changes to a live production environment: [.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

The pipeline leverages [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration and deployment, [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/) for container images storage, a small droplet on [**DigitalOcean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for hosting the application and [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as a first easy solution to run the prod containers. The key stages include building, testing, and deploying the application across the frontend, rest-server, and socket-server components.
