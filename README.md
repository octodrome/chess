# Chess

## Overview

Welcome to **Chess**! This project started as a **proof of concept**, aimed at exploring the entire development pipelineâ€”from frontend to backend and DevOps. The goal is to build a fully functional online chess game, combining real-world chess mechanics with modern web technologies.

Users can seamlessly play chess directly in their browser, either against an AI opponent or in real-time with friends.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

The Chess app uses an automated pipeline to streamline the process from code changes to a live production environment: [.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

The pipeline leverages [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration and deployment, [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/) for container images storage, a small droplet on [**DigitalOcean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for hosting the application and [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as a first easy solution to run the prod containers. The key stages include building, testing, and deploying the application across the frontend, backend, and socket-server components.
