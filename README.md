# Chess Web App

## Overview
Welcome to the Chess Web App! This project began as a proof of concept, driven by a desire to explore the full development pipeline, from frontend to backend and DevOps. The goal was to create a fully functional online chess game, blending real-world gameplay mechanics with modern web technologies.

This web app allows users to seamlessly play chess directly in their browser, either against an AI opponent or with friends in real-time.

Feel free to explore the app while I am building it: http://165.22.119.201/
